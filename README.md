# Speedrun Ethereum - Challenge 1: Decentralized Staking App


## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains my solution for **Challenge 1: Decentralized Staking** from the Speedrun Ethereum curriculum.

The goal of this challenge is to build a decentralized crowdfunding/staking application (`Staker.sol`) that allows users to pool their Ether together. The smart contract acts as a state machine with the following logic:

- **Staking**: Users can call a `stake()` function to deposit ETH into the contract.
- **Threshold & Deadline**: The contract tracks a target amount of ETH (threshold) and a specific time limit (deadline).
- **Success Scenario**: If the balance is greater than or equal to the threshold by the deadline, the `execute()` function can be called to send the funds to an external `ExampleExternalContract` (simulating a DeFi protocol or DAO).
- **Failure Scenario**: If the deadline passes and the threshold is not met, the users can call `withdraw()` to retrieve their funds.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Scaffold-ETH 2
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: Next.js, RainbowKit, Tailwind CSS
- **Environment**: Hardhat (Localhost)

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure your machine meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version >= 18.17 (LTS recommended)
- **Yarn**: v1 or v2+ (Package manager)
- **Git**: Version control system

To verify your installations, run:

```bash
node -v
yarn -v
git --version
```

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide
This project uses Scaffold-ETH 2, which requires running three separate terminals to simulate the blockchain environment, deploy contracts, and host the frontend.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the project code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LightyWind22/challenge-1-decentralized-staking.git
cd challenge-1-decentralized-staking
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install all necessary node modules for both the Hardhat backend and the Next.js frontend:

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run (3-Terminal Workflow)
Please follow these steps in order. You will need three separate terminal windows/tabs open.

### Terminal 1: Start the Local Blockchain
This command starts a local Ethereum network (Hardhat network) on your machine. Keep this terminal running.

```bash
yarn chain
```

### Terminal 2: Deploy Smart Contracts
Open a second terminal. This command deploys your `Staker.sol` and `ExampleExternalContract.sol` to the local network created in Terminal 1.

```bash
yarn deploy
```

> **Note**: If you modify the smart contract code later, you must run `yarn deploy` again.

### Terminal 3: Start the Frontend
Open a third terminal. This command starts the React/Next.js application.

```bash
yarn start
```

Once started, open your web browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## 🧪 How to Test the Functionality
Once the application is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), follow these steps to verify the solution:

1. **Connect Wallet**:
   - Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right.
   - Use the "Burner Wallet" (a temporary local wallet) generated by the app.

2. **Get Test Funds**:
   - Click the "Faucet" button (top right) or the generic faucet icon to grab some test ETH on the localhost network.

3. **Stake ETH**:
   - Enter an amount (e.g., `0.5`) in the UI input box.
   - Click the **Stake** button.
   - **Verification**: You should see the "Total Staked" amount increase and a "Stake" event appear in the history.

4. **Simulate Logic (Success/Fail)**:
   - **To Test Success**: Stake enough ETH to exceed the threshold (e.g., `1 ETH`) before the time runs out. Then, click **Execute**. The funds should move to the `ExampleExternalContract`.
   - **To Test Failure/Withdraw**: Do not reach the threshold. Wait for the time to expire (or check the contract logic). Once the deadline passes, the **Withdraw** button should become active, allowing you to get your ETH back.
